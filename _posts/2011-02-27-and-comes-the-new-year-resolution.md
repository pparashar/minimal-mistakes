Well, it&#8217;s never too late! I, at least, had a resolution not to have the same resolutions this year again. So here goes the list. I would:

  1. Drive a lot, again. Cover most weekend getaways in and around Delhi this year.
  2. Play at least two Cricket matches with real Cricket ball. Restart tennis.
  3. Write at least one blog post per week on this blog.
  4. Be a hard-core-geek again this year : explore algorithms, reverse engineer code and completely futile experiments included.
  5. Try new entrepreneurial ventures! (rephrase: when will I be aÂ billionaire ? )
