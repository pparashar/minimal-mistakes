One of the most important and highly desired feature of Gingerbread is the battery management which according to my experience elongates the battery time by more than 150%.

The better battery management in Gingerbread has been achieved using better CPU management and less battery intensive UI.

This feature alone makes Gingerbread really super-cool!
