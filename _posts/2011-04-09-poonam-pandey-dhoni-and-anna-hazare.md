In our cricket crazy country, craziest of the things happen. When the cricket is at its peek, some non-cricketing celebrity (read Poonam Pandey) becomes the talk of the nation and is on Internet everywhere. Don&#8217;t know if those searching Poonam Pandey can really recognize her by her face or are in fact remotely interested in her face; but Poonam Pandey has surely topped the charts no matter if she likes it without the top (pun intended).

&nbsp;

So here is the snapshot of Google Trends showing search hits for last 30 days, and, Poonam Pandey beats M S Dhoni, Tendulkar and even Hazare by a mile! Who said Dhoni wins the world cup?
