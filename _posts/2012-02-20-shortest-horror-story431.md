On a beautiful cold winter day, he was enjoying hot shower closing his eyes as if cherishing the waterfall.

Suddenly his elbow hit something &#8230;

&#8230;

&#8230;

&#8230;sending a chill down his spine &#8230;

&#8230; and then the whole body!

&#8230;

&#8230;

&#8230;

horror had begun to take shape&#8230;

&#8230;

&#8230;

&#8230;

he opened his eyes in horror&#8230;

&#8230;

&#8230;

&#8230;and amazement

&#8230;

&#8230; shivering and shaking &#8230; to encounter the uncertain &#8230;

&#8230;

&#8230;

&#8230;eyes opened slowly to a sharp revelation&#8230;

&#8230;

&#8230;

that his elbow had hit &#8230;

&#8230;

&#8230;

the cold water shower knob &#8230;

and hit it hard to turn it open full&#8230;

&#8230;

&#8230;

&#8230;and he lived in fear ever after!
