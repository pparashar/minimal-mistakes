  This post is in continuation to <a title="SEO… huh? An Experiment with SEO" href="http://www.prashantparashar.com/seo-search-engine-optimization-experiment-2012-03.html" target="_blank">this post</a> on the SEO experiment.
</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify">
  WTF is this SEO Experiment?
</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  I am experimenting changes to a fully keywords-based website to see the effects on the SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and web-traffic of the website. You too can be a part of it, just guess the website from the description below and you get a chance to experiment! Yes, if you are in top 3 of who correctly guesses the website, you would be entitled to make one change to the website/experiment and see its impact.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  <p style="text-align: justify">
    This is how the entire process of the SEO experiment unfolded.
  </p>
  
  <h3 style="text-align: justify">
    Choosing a domain name
  </h3>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify">
    This is by far one of the most important and time consuming exercise when starting a website. Just make a word and you would find a domain already registered with that name. And somebody said choose the right keyword in domain name! Crazy!<br /> For me it was easy since I was not building a product but a small experiment. I checked out the list of top 10-20 keywords for year 2011 for India and zeroed in to some of the top keywords:
  </p>
  
  <ol style="text-align: justify">
    <li>
      Facebook
    </li>
    <li>
      Facebook Login
    </li>
    <li>
      IRCTC
    </li>
    <li>
      IRCTC Login
    </li>
    <li>
      PNR Status
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify">
    Finally, registered an arbitrary long domain name so that it contains the keywords.
  </p>
  
  <h3 style="text-align: justify">
    Setup Analytics, Google Webmaster Tools and Adsense
  </h3>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify">
    All I needed was to setup 3-4 static pages with Google analytics and Google Adsense account. Yes, it is needed for even a nearly bare site to provide metrics.
  </p>
  
  <h3 style="text-align: justify">
    Content &#8211; SEO & Original
  </h3>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify">
    Original content around the keywords is required for a better SEO as well as better site. Most part of setting up was spent writing few paragraph about each of the strong keyword such that keywords are repeated.
  </p>
  
  <h3 style="text-align: justify">
    Guess the website
  </h3>
  
  <p style="text-align: justify">
    Below is a screenshot of the website traffic and the keywords bringing traffic to the site. From the below picture, if you guess the website right , you win a chance to run one experiment of your choice on the website. Why would you care to run one SEO experiment? Because, you have a website which has consistent traffic and a disposable(?) product so that you don&#8217;t worry about your boss when playing with SEO. Of course, I am taking the risk of running into Google Panda and ending up sacrificing an Adsense income of ~ $100 a month.   Here is the Pic, now <strong>Guess FAST~~~~~~~~~</strong>
