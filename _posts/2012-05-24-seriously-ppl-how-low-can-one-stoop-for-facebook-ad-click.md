Spotted one Facebook ad from some Internet company. This is amusing. Can we be plain arbitrary or even mischievous to get better CTR for Facebook Ads? Is this probably why there is so much being said about Facebook Ads lately?

<div id="attachment_501" style="max-width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://www.prashantparashar.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/kyazoonga_ad.png"><img class=" wp-image-501 " src="http://www.prashantparashar.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/kyazoonga_ad.png" alt="" width="750" height="200" srcset="http://www.prashantparashar.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/kyazoonga_ad.png 984w, http://www.prashantparashar.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/kyazoonga_ad-300x79.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">

</div>

It won&#8217;t hard to fill in the blanks in the above ad. No connect and no context with the brand.
