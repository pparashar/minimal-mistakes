> Blogs are to books what Agile SaaS products are to Enterprise Suites.

Well, everybody faces the writers block. Not because they don&#8217;t have enough ideas,  but because they don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s ripe/finished yet to be published (err&#8230; released). A blog post is like a product that you are going to release. You keep on working on it to give it the launch &#8220;finish&#8221; so that it is &#8220;perfect&#8221; &#8211; keeping it away from the market for really long &#8211; and sometimes, till market out-times you.

> The word is &#8220;Just Release It&#8221;. Don&#8217;t wait it to be perfect, it will never be. Just get the &#8220;Minimum Viable Product&#8221; out of the door.

Similarly, I am now going to follow **Minimum Viable Blog Post** methodology for the blog.

  * Don&#8217;t keep numerous DRAFTs to give them that ripe finish.
  * Right small, right in parts
  * Don&#8217;t try to cover the entire subject/issue
  * No need to create a background on the topic. Trust your readers, they get it.
  * Post frequently
  * Accept feedback. Update post if amiss.

I (am going to) love the agile for blog . Happy blogging! Do you already follow the agile way of blogging? Do share
