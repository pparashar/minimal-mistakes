  There isn&#8217;t a core sales competency either! The sales as a competency does not exist in isolation anymore. If you are a sales guy and just &#8220;negotiations&#8221;, &#8220;bidding&#8221;, &#8220;references&#8221;, &#8220;strong customer base&#8221; without much of the &#8220;backing&#8221; is of no use in the long term.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  The backing is the knowledge of the product or services you are selling; knowledge about the vast fields of your market including competition, technology and trends. Today&#8217;s sales guy has to offer choices, integration, solution &#8211; in a single meeting with the customer (sometimes the only meeting) &#8211; apart from RoI, features and demonstration. You have to the master of that &#8220;one&#8221; meeting.

<h3 style="text-align: justify">
  <del>Selling a product</del> Solving a problem
</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify">
   If you are a product sales guy, you are NOT selling your product. You are solving a pain-point of a customer. You need to know:
</p>

<ol style="text-align: justify">
  <li>
    What are the pain-points the customer have. Know the pain points of the target market overall. Study the pain points of a specific customer you are meeting.
  </li>
  <li>
    Which of these problems is your product solving. Know your product thoroughly. If it is a technology product, you need to get a first hand experience of the product and features.
  </li>
  <li>
    What configuration options are available that the customers can vary.
  </li>
  <li>
    What all integration are supported so that you can offer options to integrate with existing market solutions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Your product deep-down. A lot more than any of your prospective customer know from outside.
  </li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Only when you know your product, you can offer solution to the problem of a customer rather than selling a product. Even though it&#8217;s just price differentiation.
</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify">
  <del>Selling a Service</del> Providing a Solution
</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  If you are selling services, it is not a lot different from selling a product. It&#8217;s just that you have to be even more wide in the knowledge about the bouquet of services and , quite often, have to  assemble a new set of bouquet during each of the customer meetings.  In services, you cannot even go out selling until you know the problem; and after understanding the problem you need to assemble your services to &#8220;provide the solution&#8221;.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  So if you a software services sales guy, you can hardly do much with the sales skills alone. You are not a sales guy, you are a solution architect. Software sales guy must have basic to intermediate solution architecture skills. Today&#8217;s software sales guy would need to
</p>

<ol style="text-align: justify">
  <li>
    Understand the problem (which means she understands the entire technology stack and services)
  </li>
  <li>
    Reach onto a basic solution out of the services he provides.
  </li>
  <li>
    Perform initial scoping so that basic costing range can be discussed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand the technology so that he can fit the technologies in the solution for the basic understanding at least. He just can&#8217;t be oblivion to where MySQL or MongoDB fits in and what advantages Spring or Hibernate provides or what cost advantages the AWS or Rackspace have
  </li>
</ol>

  In a nutshell-
