A lot has been written about work-life balance. However, another balance that an entrepreneur needs to keep is the &#8220;_**work-gyan balance**_&#8220;.  As an entrepreneur your primary goal is to get shit done &#8211; the work; and the secondary is to remain connected to the world &#8211; networking & keeping up with trends &#8211; the gyan side.   The balance between your time spent on gyan vs the real stuff is critical and more so when you are a bootstrapped startup.

Below is an interesting take on work-gyan balance for a bootstrapped entrepreneurs over a month (in a lighter vein).
