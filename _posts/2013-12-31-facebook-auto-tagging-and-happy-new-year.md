Posted some images last week on Facebook and it suggested to tag some friends in those pictures&#8230; and, Facebook was damn accurate in recognizing those people! I was like&#8230;wow! WTF! The future flashed right in.

Imagine, you are wearing a Gooogle Glass device on a busy train station and as you gaze through the crowd, all the faces are automatically identified, shown with their last tweets, birthdays, home town, activity etc Â with popping up balloons of &#8220;start chat&#8221; now! In a blitz, you could start the conversation with any random person knowing his past history, interests, affiliations, educations , the family tree and common friends, common interests & places etc.

Sounds like a sci-fi, but indeed, technology has come a long way, faster than anyone could imagine, much faster. The only prediction for the year ahead one could make is that it is going to way different and ahead of what can be predicted! We are moving at a breathtaking pace!

Happy new year 2014! Enjoy the technology!
