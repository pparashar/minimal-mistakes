Over last couple of years I added bunch of links to useful resources on current technology on a wide variety of topics that include Machine Learning, Statistics, Probability, Mathematics, Arduino, Distributed systems and many more. A good bunch contains solid tutorials links,Books PDF and some are very specific articles on a very specific technology.
Before sharing here, I tried to categorize them well, however, there may still be some duplication across which should aid discovery only. Would keep on updating this stuff with whatever I find interesting on Internet. So, help yourself, this is the link:
